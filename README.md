# C++ Roadmap Progress Repository

This repository documents my progress as I work through a structured C++ project roadmap.

The goal is not to build a single polished product, but to **learn C++ deeply by building many small, focused projects** that cover core language features, systems concepts, and practical software engineering patterns.

Each folder or project in this repo represents a step in that journey.

---

## Purpose

- Practice modern C++ through hands-on projects
- Build intuition for memory, performance, and system-level thinking
- Learn by implementing, not just reading
- Track growth over time in a visible, structured way

This repo is a learning log as much as it is a codebase.

---

## Structure

Projects are organized by milestone in the roadmap. As new topics are covered, new folders and projects will appear.

Examples of topics covered over time:

- Core language fundamentals
- Memory management
- Data structures and algorithms
- File I/O and parsing
- Networking basics
- Multithreading
- Systems-style projects

---

## How to Use This Repo

Each project is self-contained and focused on a specific concept.  
You can browse the folders to see the progression of complexity and understanding.

---

## Notes

This is an evolving learning repository. Code here reflects learning stages and experimentation, not production-ready design.

Improvements and refactors are part of the process.
